# AI Agentic Workflow for Urban Planning (Student Outline)

## Course Overview
This 2-hour class introduces how to use and evaluate agentic AI workflows for urban planning and transportation research. We will focus on practical use, research rigor, and when these tools should (and should not) be used.

## Who This Class Is For
- Master of City Planning (MCP) students
- Students working on planning, transportation, or urban data projects
- Anyone curious about using AI workflows for research tasks

## What You Should Know Before Class
- Basic Python (variables, loops, functions)
- Basic understanding of LLMs / prompting
- Basic research methods concepts (validity, reliability, bias)
- No prior agent framework experience required

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you will be able to:
1. Explain what an agentic AI workflow is (and how it differs from a single prompt).
2. Identify planning research tasks that are good or bad candidates for agentic AI.
3. Build and evaluate a basic Python workflow for structured evidence collection.
4. Critique a no-code workflow (Claude Code) in terms of rigor, transparency, and control.
5. Choose a workflow + validation strategy appropriate to your project.
6. Understand common practices like MCP, SKILLs

## Class Schedule (120 minutes total)

### 1) Framing: What Agentic Workflows Are (5 minutes)
- Shared vocabulary: LLM vs system vs workflow
- Core workflow parts: planning, tools, memory/context, evaluation
- Research-grade vs exploratory outputs

### 2) When Agentic AI Helps (and Hurts) (5 minutes)
- Where agentic workflows save time and improve scale
- Common risks: hallucinations, weak sources, hidden assumptions
- When human judgment should remain primary

### 3) Urban Planning Use Cases + Validity Clinic (20 minutes)
- Planning and transportation use cases (GDP, safety, policy monitoring, evidence synthesis)
- Group discussion on validity risks and validation checks
- Focus on what makes evidence defensible in academic/professional work

### 4) Tutorial A: Python Workflow for City GDP Extraction (40 minutes)
- Build and inspect a simple agentic workflow in Python / Colab
- Search, extract, validate, and review city-level GDP values
- Add basic source checks and confidence labels

### Break (10 minutes)

### 5) Tutorial B: Claude Code Workflow (Comparison Demo) (25 minutes)
- Run a no-code / prompt-driven workflow for the same task
- Compare outputs, evidence links, and low-confidence cases
- Discuss what becomes easier vs harder to verify

### 6) Comparison Workshop: Choosing the Right Workflow (5 minutes)
- Python vs no-code tradeoffs: control, speed, transparency, reproducibility
- Use a simple decision rubric to choose a workflow for a planning task

### 7) Conclusion: Limitations, Governance, and Next Steps (5 minutes)
- Source attribution and audit trail expectations
- Reproducibility and documentation habits
- Practical safeguards before using AI-generated results in coursework/research

## What You Will Produce During Class
- A shared vocabulary / concept map
- A domain task matrix (use cases, risks, validation checks)
- A basic structured GDP extraction workflow (Python)
- A comparison critique of Python vs Claude Code (or Codex, Gemini) workflows
- A workflow selection checklist for your own projects

## Suggested Preparation (Optional)
- Bring a laptop with access to Google Colab
- Think of one planning or transportation research task you are working on
- Be ready to discuss what counts as trustworthy evidence in that context
- Register an account for any coding agents (Claude Code, Codex or Gemini)

## Important Note
This class emphasizes evaluation and research rigor, not just automation speed. The goal is to learn how to use AI workflows responsibly in planning research.
